/*
1. Date 
Design a class called Date. The class should store a date in three integers: month, day, 
and year. There should be member functions to print the date in the following forms: 
12/25/2014 
December 25, 2014 
25 December 2014 
Demonstrate the class by writing a complete program implementing it. 

Input Validation: Do not accept values for the day greater than 31 or less than 1. Do 
not accept values for the month greater than 12 or less than 1
