Blake: Let me have your attention for a moment! 'Cause you're talking about what?
You're talking about...[puts out his cigarette]...
bitching about that sale you shot, some son of a bitch don't wanna buy land,
somebody don't want what you're selling, some broad you're
trying to screw, so forth. Let's talk about something important.
[to John Williamson] Are they all here?

John: All but one.

Blake: Well, I'm going anyway. Let's talk about something important.
[to Shelley] Put that coffee down! Coffee's for closers only.
[Shelley scoffs] You think I'm fucking with you? I am not fucking with you.
I'm here from downtown. I'm here for Mitch and Murray. And
I'm here on a mission of mercy. Your name's Levene?

Shelley: Yeah.

Blake: You call yourself a salesman, you son of a bitch?

Dave: I don't gotta listen to this shit. [stands up to leave]

Blake: You certainly don't, pal, 'cause the good news is you're fired. The bad news
is you've got- all you've got- just one week to
regain your jobs, starting with tonight. Starting with tonight's sit.
[sardonically] Oh, have I got your attention now? [Dave Moss sits
back down] Good. 'Cause we're adding a little something to this month's sales contest.
As you all know, first prize is Cadillac
Eldorado. Anybody wanna see second prize? Second prize's a set of steak knives.
Third prize is you're fired. [Dave, George, and Shelley
glance uncomfortably at each other] Do you get the picture? Are you laughing now?
You got leads. Mitch and Murray paid good money. Get
their names to sell them! You can't close the leads you're given, you can't close shit,
you are shit, hit the bricks, pal, and beat it
'cause you are going out!

Shelley: The leads are weak.

Blake: The leads are weak. Fuckin' leads are weak? You're weak. I've been in this business
15 years.

Dave: What's your name?

Blake: FUCK! YOU! That's my name!! You know why, mister? 'Cause you drove a Hyundai to
get here tonight, I drove an $80,000 BMW. That's
my name! [to Shelley] And your name is "you're wanting". And you can't play in a man's game.
You can't close them. [at a near whisper]
Then go home home and tell your wife your troubles. [to everyone again] Because only one thing
counts in this life! Get them to sign on
the line which is dotted! You hear me, you fuckin' faggots? [Blake flips over a blackboard which
has two sets of letters on it: ABC, and
AIDA.] A-B-C. A-Always, B-Be, C-Closing. Always be closing. Always be closing! A-I-D-A.
Attention, Interest, Decision, Action.
Attention -- do I have your attention? Interest -- are you interested? I know you are, 'cause it's
fuck or walk. You close, or you hit
the bricks! Decision -- have you made your decision for Christ?! And action. A-I-D-A. Get out there!
You got the prospects coming in.
You think they came in to get outta the rain? A man don't walk on the lot lest he wants to buy.
They're sitting out there waiting to
give you their money! Are you gonna take it? Are you man enough to take it? [Shelley glares.]

Dave: Incredible.

Blake: [to Moss] What's the problem, pal? You. Moss. [Blake sits down.]

Dave: You're such a hero, you're so rich. How come you're coming down here, waste your time with such
a bunch of bums?

Blake: [smiles condescendingly.] You see this watch?
[Blake takes off his gold watch.] You see this watch?

Dave: Yeah.

Blake: That watch cost more than your car. I made $970,000 last year. How much'd you make?
You see, pal, that's who I am, and you're
nothing. Nice guy? I don't give a shit. Good father? Fuck you, go home and play with your kids.
[to everyone] You wanna work here?
Close! [to George Aaronow] You think this is abuse? You think this is abuse, you cocksucker?
You can't take this, how can take the
abuse you get on a sit?! You don't like it, leave. I can go out there tonight, the materials you got,
make myself $15,000! Tonight!
In two hours! Can you? Can you? Go and do likewise! A-I-D-A! Get mad, you son of a bitches! Get mad!
You know what it takes to sell
real estate? [He pulls something out of his brief case. He is holding two brass balls on string]
It takes brass balls to sell real
estate. [He puts them away after a pause.] Go and do likewise, gents. The money's out there. You pick it up,
it's yours. You don't,
I've got no sympathy for you. You wanna go out on those sits tonight and close, close, it's yours.
If not, you're gonna be shining my
shoes. And you know what you'll be saying, bunch of losers, sitting around in a bar.
[in a mocking weak voice] "Oh yeah, I used to be
a salesman, it's a tough racket." [He takes out large stack of red index cards tied together with string
from his briefcase.] These
are the new leads. These are the Glengarry leads. And to you, they're gold. And you don't get them. Why?
Because to give them to you
is just throwing them away. [He hands the stack to John Williamson.] They're for closers. I'd wish you
good luck, but you wouldn't
know what to do with it if you got it. [to Moss as he puts on his watch again] And to answer your question,
pal, why am I here? I came
here because Mitch and Murray asked me to, they asked for a favor. I said, the real favor, follow my advice
and fire your fuckin' ass because a loser is a loser.
