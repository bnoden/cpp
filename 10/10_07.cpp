/*
  7.    
Name Arranger 
Write  a  program  that  asks  for  the  user’s  first,  middle,  and  last  names.  The  names  
should be stored in three different character arrays. The program should then store, 
in a fourth array, the name arranged in the following manner: the last name followed 
by  a  comma  and  a  space,  followed  by  the  first  name  and  a  space,  followed  by  the  
middle name. For example, if the user entered “ 
Carol Lynn Smith
”, it should store 
“ 
Smith, Carol Lynn
” in the fourth array. Display the contents of the fourth array 
on the screen.
