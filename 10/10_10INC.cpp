/*
10. replaceSubstring Function 
Write a function named replaceSubstring. The function should accept three C-string 
or stringobject  arguments.  Let’s  call  them string1, string2,  and string3.  It  
should search string1 for all occurrences of string2. When it finds an occurrence of 
string2, it should replace it with string3. For example, suppose the three arguments 
have the following values: 
string1:	“the dog jumped over the fence”
string2:	“the”
string3:	“that” 
With these three arguments, the function would return a string object with the value 
“that dog jumped over that fence.” Demonstrate the function in a complete program.
