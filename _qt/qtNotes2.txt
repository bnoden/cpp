Qt Tips: 

	If your class only uses pointers or references for a class type, you can avoid including 
		the header by using forward declaration. This drastically reduces compilationt time. 

	You can connect a signal to another signal. The second signal is emitted when first one is triggered.


Signals and Slots - and connections 
	Signal - message sent by object 
	Slot - function to be called when signal is triggered 
	connect - function specifies which signal is linked to which slot 

		connect(sender, &Sender::signalName,
			receiver, &Receiver::slotName);
